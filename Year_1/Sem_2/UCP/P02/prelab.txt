1a)look for marvellous.h in a predefined standard library directory
1b)look for marvellou.h in the same directory
1c)Everytime LENGTH is used, it will be swapped to 100 before compiling.
1d)Everytime CUBE with input for x is used, it will swap to x^3
1e)x + x^3 + x^6
1f)would not work
1g)

2a) as global variables can make code harder to read due to high coupling. 
Can be accessed from every function and across different files
2b)the function would not be able to be accessed by other files. 

3a)database.h, util.h.
3b)database.h, util.c, interface.c, main.c, database.c
3c)main.o, database.o, util.o and interface.o
3d)main.o and database.o
3e)all 4 .o files
3f)util.o

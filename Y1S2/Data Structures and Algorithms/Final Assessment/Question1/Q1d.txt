Question 1c)

For mergesort
-The max depth of the recursion would be approximately log2(100) levels as you
half the array size by 2 at each level, you will reach the end after log2(100) splits.
-The number of function calls would be (2n - 1) + (n - 1) + (1 if you include mergesort). 
As number of times m-rec is called is 2n - 1 and number of times merge is 
called is n - 1. Therfore number of function calls for an array of 100 elements
would be 298 or 299 ( if you include mergesort() ).


For quicksort with leftmost pivot
-The max depth of recursion would be be 100 levels for an array of 100 elements. 
As it does not split the array at all, it will have to check each element 
individually, therefore recusion depth of 100 for an array of 100 elements.

-The number of function calls is (2n - 1) + (n - 1) + (1 if you include quicksort).
As number of times qsort_rec is called is 2n - 1 and number of times dopart 
is called is n - 1. Therefore number of function calls for an array of 100 elements
is 298 or 299 ( if you include quicksort() ).
